	// A recognizer is a program that takes a string x as input and is able to tell whether x is a sentence of a given language.
	// A grammar is a set of production rules for strings in a formal language.
	// The production rules describe how to create strings from the alphabet of the language that are valid according to the syntax of the language.
	// A grammar does not describe the meaning of a string or what can be done with it in whatever context â€“ it only describes its form.
	// What is important here is to realize that grammars are at the heart of regular expressions because without a grammar,
	//  you cannot define or use a regular expression.
